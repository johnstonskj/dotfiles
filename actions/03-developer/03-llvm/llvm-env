# To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

# llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
# parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin

# For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
